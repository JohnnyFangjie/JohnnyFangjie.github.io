+++

Out of all plucked instruments. The Pipa is the one that fascinates me the most. If I had to describe it with one word, I would say colorful due to its numerous finger techniques and sound possibilities.

'Colorful? We cannot even hear colors' you may think. But if you heard the sounds that exist within this instrument, you would end up agreeing, or at least, understanding my point of view.

For instance,you can imitate an electric guitar, bass, acoustic guitar, or an arabic oud, make quite convincing horse and swan sounds, drum sounds, and others.  
It has 3 main ways of creating a tremolo sound. Wheeling （轮指）， swaying （遥指）， picking (滚指).
For reference, the wheeling and tremolo picking have equivalents in Guitar.  Similarly, you may wheel with 3,4, or 5 fingers, although the wheeling technique is different to the Guitar's.
